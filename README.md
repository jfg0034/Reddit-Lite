## ðŸ“Œ Notes
This is a read-only app focused on lightweight data. Currently, posts and search results do not support pagination and are limited to 25 items per subreddit or search query. Comments are displayed with some nested replies visible; however, retrieving large comment threads requires additional API calls, which are not supported in this project.
